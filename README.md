TreeUI
======

**jQuery plugin for implementing a FLAT UI with drill down functionality.**

#Setup and Usage
 
    1. Clone this plugin to anywhere in your project.
    
    2. For the html file in question, point your script tag src to the directory location of the plugin.

    3. The plugin only effects elements encapsulated within elements of the "tree" class designaion.

    4. There are three internal class designations for any elements within a tree:
        * Branch: The Branch is the primary class designation, enabling drill down functionality.
        * Title: The Title class designation, which is used to trigger the showtoggle event for other elements within the tree.
        * Body: The Body class designation, which is the main content of any branch and is autohidden on document load. 

**Happy Hacking!**
