TreeUI
======

**jQuery plugin for implementing a FLAT UI with drill down functionality.**

#Setup and Usage:

4. There are three internal class designations for any elements within a tree:
    * Branch: Primary class designation, enabling drill down functionality.
    * Title: Used to trigger the showtoggle event for other elements within the tree.
    * Body: The main content of any branch and is autohidden on document load.
